Ncurses differs a little from readline with windows. The main difference 
is that the first window exists _always_ and it's a state window.
To this window are sent informations about users' staus change.
Keyboard operation details are in README file.

Recommended settings:

	set display_ack 3
	set display_sent 1
	set make_window 2

The status bar contains clock, users own number details 
 (color determines the status: black -- offline, white 
-- avail, gray -- busy, sate -- invisible), current window number, 
information about activity in other windows, new mail ect.

New format has been added - "statusbar". Similarly to the others it supports colors, but doesn't have
complection, blinking ect. But there are conditional constructions
and extended information instead:

	%{activity}	list of active windows
	%{debug}	we are in debug window
	%{descr}	our description/our status description
	%{mail}		information on the number of e-mails or empty if no mail
	%{more}		any added information in window when it's scrolled
	%{nick}		our nickname {XXX not implemented yet}
	%{query}	user/interlocutor in the current window
	%{query_descr}	user description
	%{query_ip}	user IP
	%{query_nickname}	users nickname in the current window
	%{session}	session ID or session alias
	%{time}		current time, format defined by the bar_timestamp
	%{typing}	text input by the caller
	%{uin}		own number {XXX not implemented yet}
	%{url}		ekg2 webside
	%{version}	ekg2 version
	%{window}	current windows number

In IRC window are also available:
	%{irctopic}	channel topic
	%{irctopicby}	channel topic author
	%{ircmode}	flags on a channel


Conditional constructions allow to add text to the status
bar only when the specified condition is met. Structures 
are as follows:

	%{?condition text}	text will be displayed when the condition is met
	%{?!condition text}	text will be displayed when the condition is met

The condition may be the availability of any of the above-named texts.
For example, if there is conversation in the current window, the condition
%{?query ...} is met. If own number is not configured, the condition
%{?!uin ...} is met. There are also:

	%{?away ...}		status busy
	%{?avail ...}		status available
	%{?notavail ...}	status offline
	%{?invisible ...}	status invisible
	%{?more ...}		any added information in window when it's scrolled
	%{?query_away ...}	interlocutor is away
	%{?query_avail ...}	interlocutor is avail
	%{?query_notavail ...}	interlocutor is offline
	%{?query_invisible ...}	interlocutor is invisible

Conditions can be nested. For example, condition %{?query %{!?query_descr ...}} 
will be displayed if the conversation is being continued, but the caller doesn't have
the status with description.

So that incredible status bars can be created, but the default should be
enough for everyone. The status bar can have up to 5 lines. Additional 
lines are described by the formats: ,,statusbar2'', ,,statusbar3'' ect.
If there is a format ,,statusbar1''then it has priority over ,,statusbar''


You can also include a header. This is a bar located above the windows, 
described by the formats: ,header'', ,,header1'', ,,header2'' ect.
It's analogy to the status bar and the same formats are available.

contact list is (usually) available on the right side after setting the 
variable ncurses:contacts to 1 (on). Contacts which are writing us currently
are set to flashing (in fact it's a blink element of the structure 
userlist_t). Ui-ncurses supports this by reading the appropriate theme
and by correctly display.
