auto_connect
	type: bool
	default value: 1
	
	If set to true, this session will be connected automagically
	on program startup.

charset
	type: string
	default value: none
	
	Character set to use when fetching or sending messages. If NULL, no
	conversion will be made - i.e. current charset will be used.

dotfile_suffix
	type: string
	default value: none
	
	Suffix added to dotfiles on message retrieval. It allows you to use one
	than one client on the same incoming message directory.

max_filesize
	type: integer
	default value: 16384
	
	Files larger than value of this variable won't be read by xmsg plugin.

max_oneshot_files
	type: integer
	default value: 25
	
	Max count of files that'll be processed during one function call.
	If function reaches that count, it'll break off the loop, and set resume
	timer (see: oneshot_resume_timer). Value of 0 means no limit.

name_separator
	type: string
	default value: .
	
	Separator dividing filename into main part (used in UID-s) and suffix.
	Filename will be divided on last occurrence of this character. If null,
	dividing will be disabled. If more than one char, the one closer to
	the end of filename will be used.

oneshot_resume_timer
	type: integer
	default value: 3
	
	Delay (in seconds), after which the process, stopped by reaching
	max_oneshot_files, will be resumed. If set to 0, no autoresume'll
	be done (the process'll be resumed on next function call, for example
	on next /connect).

rescan_timer
	type: integer
	default value: 0 or 300
	
	Interval of rescanning incoming message directory. It shouldn't be used
	(and thus is set to 0 by default) in inotify environments.

send_cmd
	type: string
	default value: (none)
	
	Command used to send messages to xmsg plugin; it'll be launched with
	two args - an UID (without xmsg:) and path to file with message inside.
	Note that xmsg doesn't check return value from this handler app/script,
	so errors should be returned by use of session's incoming message dir.

unlink_sent
	type: bool
	default value: 1
	
	If set to true, incoming message files will be removed after reading.
	Otherwise, xmsg will create dotfiles to mark them.

unlink_toobig
	type: bool
	default value: 0
	
	If set to true, files larger than max_filesize will be deleted,
	otherwise they'll be ignored (and dotfiles for them will be created).
