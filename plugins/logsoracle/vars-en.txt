// logsoracle plugin - variables
// (c) copyright 2006 Szymon Biliñski <ecimon@babel.pl>

auto_connect:
	type: bool
	default value: false
	
	autoconnect with the database at startup

db_login
	type: text
	default value: none
	
	database login (schema name). 
	it's generally a good idea to create a new schema for
	EKG2 purposes (don't forget to create all required database
	objects - see logsoracle.sql file for more details)

db_password
	type: text
	default value: none.
	
	database password associated with schema specified by
	'db_login' variable

log_messages
	type: bool
	default value: true
	
	if this is set to true then all passing messages (both sent and
	recieved) will be logged into the database. it's rather smart 
	to keep this on ;)

log_status
	type: bool
	default value: true
	
	if true then all status changes (both your's and people from 
	the roster) will be logged into the database.
	this might generate a lot of data/queries if you have many 
	contacts or connect/disconnect very often. in that case try
	disabling this feature or create a database trigger which
	will filter out unnecessary status changes before new inserts.  

logging_active
	type: bool
	default value: true
	
	if for some reason you want to disable logging for a while and
	keep the plugin loaded in memory then set this to false.
