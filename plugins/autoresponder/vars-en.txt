allowed_sessions
	type: string
	default value: (none)
	
	A comma-separated list of sessions, for which autoresponder plugin
	will be used. Both UIDs and aliases can be used.
	
	Note that when using this plugin with a "gg" session, you need to
	ignore or add to your roster the special user "gg:0", who sends "system
	messages". Otherwise, the server may drop your connection right after
	establishing it.

answer
	type: string
	default value: (none)
	
	Correct answer for your question - i.e. if user does reply with exact
	string, his further messages will be delivered to user. If null, then
	autoresponder will expect user to rewrite the 'question' string.

greeting
	type: string
	default value: (none)
	
	If set, that message will be sent to user, when he sends correct
	answer.

match_mode
	type: integer
	default value: 1
	
	Defines match mode for comparing specified answer with incoming
	messages. Possible values:
		0 - exact match
		1 - substring match (answer must be somewhere in msg)

question
	type: string
	default value: (none)
	
	Question sent to unknown user on incoming message receival. If null,
	autoresponder will be disabled.
