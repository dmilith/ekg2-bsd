EKG2 uses the autotools package for building. If you are checking out the
source code directly from CVS, you probably need to call:
	$ ./autogen.sh [configure options]
before invoking make to perform the actual build, or:
	$ NOCONFIGURE=1 ./autogen.sh
if you don't want autogen to call configure after creating it.

If you got the source code from a snapshot, this had probably already been done
for you, and you only need to call:
	$ ./configure [configure options]
	$ make
	# make install

To see all available options for configure (or autogen.sh), please use
'--help'. If compilation fails on one of the plugins, you can append '-k' flag
to make, so it'll ignore the failures (but please report the problem to the
authors).
