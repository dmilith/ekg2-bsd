/* Few words about statuses:
 *
 * All of the enum statuses are proritity-sorted. I mean, if we want to determine, which of the two given statuses is more
 * important, we just do standard arithmetic comparation (e.g. (status1 > status2)). The statuses are also divided into few
 * functional groups.
 *
 * EKG_STATUS_NULL is just declared for fun. It can be used locally (e.g. in functions, where status can be set conditionally,
 * to see if some condition was true), but it can't be passed to core. None of the core functions recognizes it, so it will be
 * probably treated like unknown status. I even don't think anyone would use that long name, instead of putting 0.
 *
 * The next two statuses, blocked and error, represent situations, in which messages sent to user probably won't be delivered.
 * They both aren't currently treated specially by core, but this may change in future. If You want to check, if given status
 * belongs to that group, you should use EKG_STATUS_IS_NODELIVERY.
 *
 * Then, we've got two kinds of N/A. Both of them mean the user may be unavailable at the moment, but the messages will be
 * delivered or queued. EKG_STATUS_UNKNOWN would probably be the lowest prioritized of these statuses, so it is used as a mark
 * for above group, and EKG_STATUS_NA would be the highest one, so it is used as a mark for all N/A statuses. This group
 * (combined with above) is identified by macro EKG_STATUS_IS_NA.
 *
 * Next status, EKG_STATUS_INVISIBLE, is very problematic. It means that user has sent us an N/A status, but some magic says
 * it is available although. It's hard to say, if it's an N/A status, or more 'deep kind of away' (often invisible is used
 * when someone goes AFK for a long time). I don't think it should be used as some kind of mark, and also shouldn't be 'less
 * available' than EKG_STATUS_NA, so it's put after it. But this _can change_.
 *
 * Status described above starts the third group of statuses, aways. These are statuses, which say that user is connected with
 * server, and messages are delivered directly to him/her, but he/she is probably AFK, busy or like that. All those statuses
 * are grouped by macro EKG_STATUS_IS_AWAY.
 *
 * And the last formal group is available-statuses. The first of them, most traditional 'available', is a mark for this
 * and above group. The macro is EKG_STATUS_IS_AVAIL.
 *
 * The real last group is designed for special use only. Currently, there are only statuses for setting and disabling auto-away
 * mode in EKG2. These three can be passed only to session_status_set(), and aren't recognized by everything else.
